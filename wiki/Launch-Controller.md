# Launch Controller

A mission-control console that builds your launch pad and flies your rocket.

## Overview

The Launch Controller is a solid **3-wide × 2-tall** console — a dark gunmetal chassis with a glowing,
animated "computer brain" face (a live screen, projector arms, and a pulsing light band). It does two
jobs from one block: **build** a launch pad from loaded materials, and **fuel + launch** a rocket parked
on that pad. Place it facing an open area; it builds and oversees the pad in front of it.

## Obtaining

**Craft** (shaped):

```text
W R W
P C P
W R W
```

`W` = [Station Wall](Station-Wall) · `P` = [Rocket Launch Pad](Rocket-Launch-Pad) ·
`R` = Redstone · `C` = Comparator

Placing it forms the full 3×2 structure (it needs the room — placement is cancelled if blocked).
Breaking any part removes the whole console and drops one controller.

## How it works

The GUI has two modes (toggle top-right):

**Build mode**

- Load building blocks into the three slots: **Launch Pad**, **Station Wall**, **Launch Gantry**.
- Pick a target **tier (T1–T4)**. The footprint grows per tier — T1 single pad, T2 a 3×3, T3 a
  3×3 ringed with Station Wall, T4 a Heavy Launch Complex with a gantry.
- **Toggle Hologram** projects a ghost of the *actual blocks* that still need placing, beamed from the
  console's arms.
- **Build Pad** lays the formation in the world **additively** — promoting an existing lower-tier pad
  to a higher tier without tearing it down. It only places blocks you've loaded.
- A live readout shows how many Pads / Wall / Gantry are still needed, plus the controller's onboard
  **Fuel / O₂ / Power** levels.

**Launch mode**

- The controller carries onboard **Fuel**, **Oxygen**, and **Power** buffers — feed them with
  [Universal Pipes](Universal-Pipe) (fluid / gas / energy layers). It pumps them into a rocket docked
  on the pad.
- Read the docked rocket's fuel/oxygen/power, pick its destination, and **Launch** straight from the
  console (you board as it lifts off).

## Details

- ID: `nerospace:launch_controller`
- A 3×2 multiblock; the filler cubes are solid (you can't walk through the console).
- Capabilities (fluid / gas / energy) are exposed on the core block for pipe automation.
