/**
 * The single door every Nerospace GUI goes through — {@code openMenu}, but it cannot take the server
 * thread with it when the host platform misbehaves.
 *
 * <p>Vanilla {@code Player#openMenu} is a plain call, so anything that throws underneath it unwinds
 * straight out through the packet handler and kills the tick loop. On a stock Fabric/NeoForge/Forge
 * server nothing does. On a Bukkit/Paper hybrid it can: opening a menu there fires
 * {@code InventoryOpenEvent}, and any listening plugin that walks the inventory drags the server's
 * item-meta bridge across modded items it was never written for (see Sentry {@code MC-NEROSPACE-E} —
 * a {@code NullPointerException} raised inside {@code CraftMetaBlockState} while a plugin read NBT
 * during our open). Hybrids are not a supported platform and we cannot fix their bridge, but a GUI
 * that refuses to open is a far better outcome than a downed server.</p>
 *
 * <p>So: catch, log once, put the player back in a clean state, tell them why, and carry on. Only
 * {@link RuntimeException} and {@link LinkageError} are caught — the failure modes a foreign platform
 * actually produces. Genuine {@code Error}s (out of memory, stack overflow) still propagate.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>POPIA/GDPR:</b> the log line and the telemetry report name the menu, never the player. No
 * name, UUID, IP, or position is recorded on this path.</p>
