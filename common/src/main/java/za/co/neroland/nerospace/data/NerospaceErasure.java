/**
 * Registers Nerospace's player-keyed stores with Neroland Core's shared {@link PlayerDataErasure} hook, so
 * one {@code /neroland data eraseme} (or Core's retention sweep) purges Nerospace together with every
 * other Nero mod. Keyed only by UUID; player identity is never logged.
 *
 * <h2>The stores, in erasure order</h2>
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Station ownership</b> ({@link StationRegistry}) — the owner UUID is anonymised to {@code ""},
 *       keeping the physical station as shared world content, and the UUID is removed from every station's member
 *       list (2.0, up to 16 members per station). The last-known-good backup file is rewritten
 *       immediately so the erased UUID is not retained there until the next periodic backup pass.</li>
 *   <li><b>Historical planet visits</b> ({@link PlanetVisitState}) — the player's whole row is dropped, and
 *       like stations the change is pushed into the backup file at once. This store holds only planet ids,
 *       never timestamps or coordinates, so there is nothing left to anonymise once the row is gone.</li>
 *   <li><b>Alien Villager reputation</b> — each {@link AlienVillager} keeps a {@code UUID -> score} map in
 *       its own entity NBT. This is a genuine player-data store: loaded villagers are swept below, and a villager
 *       that loads later drops the entry itself ({@link #villagerReputationFilter}).</li>
 *   <li><b>The oxygen attachment</b> — reset to a full tank.</li>
 *   <li><b>The Star Guide "seen" attachment</b> — reset to empty.</li>
 *   <li><b>Cargo routes</b> ({@link RouteRegistry}) — the player's routes are removed, their Cargo Pads
 *       anonymised (the station rule), they are dropped from every pad access list, and their flights are
 *       anonymised but keep flying: cargo is delivered or crated, never deleted, because items are not
 *       personal data — the ownership record is. Backup rewritten immediately.</li>
 *   <li><b>Village Core ownership</b> ({@link VillageCoreBlockEntity}) — the owner UUID in the core's block-entity
 *       data is cleared on every loaded core; the core keeps its stockpile, buildings and quest and becomes
 *       unclaimed. The 1.x owner display name is no longer stored at all. The {@link VillageCoreLedger}
 *       ({@code nerospace:village_cores}) turns every indexed core of the player that is in an unloaded chunk
 *       into a position-only pending clear, applied (and dropped) the moment that core loads again — across
 *       restarts, because the ledger is saved. Backup rewritten immediately.</li>
 *   <li><b>Launch cooldown</b> ({@link LaunchCooldowns}) — the transient 100-tick per-rider entry (memory only).</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>The two API-facing stores added alongside the visit history — external oxygen contributions and
 * terraforming overlays — are deliberately <em>not</em> listed: neither records a player, not even
 * transiently, so neither has anything to erase.</p>
 * <p>The NeroLink module's in-memory event bookkeeping (an edge latch and an alert cooldown, both keyed by
 * UUID, neither persisted) is dropped too.</p>
 *
 * <h2>What this can and cannot reach — stated honestly</h2>
 * <p>Several stores are only fully reachable while the player is online or the world is loaded, and
 * pretending otherwise would be worse than saying so:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Alien Villagers in unloaded chunks.</b> The sweep walks every <em>loaded</em> level. A villager
 *       whose chunk is not loaded keeps the UUID in its NBT until it loads again; when it does, its load-time
 *       filter drops the entry if the player was erased this session ({@link #erasedThisSession}) or if the
 *       player's salted key is still in the {@link VillageCoreLedger}'s bounded erasure-key list (the same
 *       pseudonymised key the core ledger keeps, at most {@value VillageCoreLedger#MAX_LEGACY} entries,
 *       {@value VillageCoreLedger#LEGACY_TTL_DAYS} days, only for a player who had visited a planet with
 *       villages). There is <em>no raw-UUID suppression list</em>, and no store was added for villagers: they
 *       reuse that one bounded, salted, time-limited key, which exists only to finish an erasure a loaded-only
 *       sweep cannot reach. A villager first loaded after the key expired keeps the entry; re-running erasure
 *       after visiting the region clears it.</li>
 *   <li><b>Village Cores in unloaded chunks.</b> Reached through the saved {@link VillageCoreLedger}: a core
 *       that was claimed or loaded on 2.x is indexed, and its owner is cleared when its chunk next loads, even
 *       after a restart. A 1.x core that has never loaded on 2.x is in no index; for those the ledger keeps a
 *       salted hash of the erased owner (pseudonymised, not anonymous; at most
 *       {@value VillageCoreLedger#MAX_LEGACY} entries, dropped after {@value VillageCoreLedger#LEGACY_TTL_DAYS}
 *       days, only for a player who had visited a planet with villages) and clears a matching core when it
 *       loads.</li>
 *   <li><b>An offline player's attachment data.</b> Both attachments are declared {@code .serialize(...)}
 *       with {@code copyOnDeath()}, so they persist in the player's own save file and do <em>not</em>
 *       "reset on their own" — the previous comment here was wrong. There is no cross-loader seam that
 *       reaches an offline player's attachments (NeoForge and Fabric both expose them only through a live
 *       {@code Player}), so for an offline player {@link #applyOnJoin} resets them the next time they log
 *       in during the same server session. Across a restart that latch is gone and the values stay until
 *       Core's account-level purge removes the player file itself.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>POPIA/GDPR:</b> nothing on this path logs who was erased — the summary logs counts only.</p>
