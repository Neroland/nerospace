/**
 * Nerospace's NeroLink module — the declaration half. Every section id, action id and event topic the
 * mod exposes is a named constant here, and {@link #init()} is the single registration entry point that
 * {@code NerospaceCommon.init()} calls last.
 *
 * <p>Nerospace backs the companion app's "space" screen: rockets and pad readiness, the player's own
 * orbital stations, planet traits and which worlds they have reached, life support, and Star Guide
 * progress. Until this module existed the bridge reported {@code nerospace: absent} and that screen had
 * nothing to draw.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>POPIA/GDPR — the visibility rule.</b> Every section is scoped to the <em>requesting</em> player's
 * UUID and nothing else:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #SECTION_STATIONS} lists only stations whose stored owner UUID equals the requester's. A
 *       station belonging to someone else is indistinguishable from one that does not exist.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #SECTION_LIFE_SUPPORT} and {@link #SECTION_STAR_GUIDE} read the requester's own attachment
 *       and advancement state through a live {@code ServerPlayer} handle — there is no path to another
 *       player's.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #SECTION_ROCKETS} is the one section over unowned world content. Rockets and launch pads
 *       carry no owner, so instead of a server-wide roster (which would map every base on the server) it
 *       answers only what the requester could already see by standing where they are: the rocket they
 *       ride plus rockets and pads inside {@code NerospaceLinkAccess.SCAN_RADIUS} blocks of them, in
 *       their own dimension, while online. Offline it answers nothing.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #SECTION_PLANETS} is public world data (gravity, airless, hazard); only the per-planet
 *       "reached" flag is player-scoped, and it comes from the requester's own advancements.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>No section ever emits another player's UUID or name. Where a shared registry is involved, the module
 * answers with a count (station slots used out of the cap), never a roster. Operator status is
 * deliberately not honoured: it is a property of a live command source, not of a UUID arriving over a
 * bridge.</p>
